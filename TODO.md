    # Database Connection Issue Resolution

## Problem
- 503 Service Unavailable errors when fetching products
- Database connection state: 'disconnected'
- Client retries failing after multiple attempts

## Root Cause
- Database connection temporarily disconnecting on Render deployment
- Middleware blocking requests during disconnected state
- Client retry delays too short for database reconnection

## Changes Made

### Server Side
- [x] Modified `server/middleware/dbMiddleware.js` to allow requests during 'connecting' state
- [x] Added logging for disconnected state attempts

### Client Side
- [x] Increased retry attempts from 3 to 5 in `client/src/api.js`
- [x] Increased base retry delay from 1000ms to 2000ms for better backoff

## Next Steps
- [ ] Deploy server changes to Render
- [ ] Deploy client changes to Vercel
- [ ] Test the application to verify improved reliability
- [ ] Monitor server logs for connection state changes
- [ ] Consider adding client-side caching for better UX during outages

## Additional Improvements (Optional)
- Add client-side fallback UI for service unavailable states
- Implement server-side request queuing during reconnection
- Add database health monitoring dashboard

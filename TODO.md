# TODO: Fix Order Validation Errors

## Issue
Mongoose validation errors for Order model - required fields in customerDetails (firstName, lastName, email, phone, address, city, state) are missing during order creation.

## Root Cause
Mismatch between frontend (Payment.js) and backend (orderController.js) API payload structure:
- Frontend was sending: `shippingAddress`, `total`, `paymentMethod`
- Backend expects: `customerDetails`, `orderSummary`, `paymentDetails`

## Solution
Updated Payment.js API call to send correct payload structure matching backend expectations.

## Changes Made
- [x] Updated Payment.js handlePlaceOrder function to map deliveryAddress to customerDetails
- [x] Added orderSummary from orderData
- [x] Added paymentDetails with method and status
- [x] Fixed name splitting for firstName/lastName
- [x] Used user.email for customerDetails.email

## Testing
- [ ] Test order placement flow from checkout to payment
- [ ] Verify all customerDetails fields are populated correctly
- [ ] Confirm order saves without validation errors
- [ ] Check order appears in user orders and admin dashboard

## Status
âœ… Frontend API payload fixed - ready for testing
